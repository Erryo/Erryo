## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate developer who loves building projects across multiple domains - from game development with SDL2 to physics simulations, web applications, and more. I enjoy exploring different programming languages and creating practical solutions to interesting problems.

### 🔍 What I Do

- 🎮 **Game Development**: Creating games from scratch using SDL2 and Go
- 🔬 **Physics & Simulation**: Building visualization tools for scientific concepts (decay chains, wave function collapse)
- 🌐 **Web Development**: Crafting web applications with JavaScript and Go
- 🚁 **Drone Programming**: Working with DJI Tello drones using Python
- 🏆 **Competitive Programming**: Participating in programming competitions (BundesWettbewerb Informatik)
- 🎨 **Creative Coding**: Experimenting with 3D animations and visual effects
